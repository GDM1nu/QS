        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Our society was founded in the second half of 2025 as an interdisciplinary academic group based in business administration.
        We were established with the vision of creating a space where students in the School of Business can explore their career paths and
        grow together through shared learning and collaboration.</p>
        <p>We focus on building practical competencies across a variety of fields.
        Our activities include career preparation sessions such as mock interviews, resume clinics, and job market research.
        We also actively participate in competitions and run study groups for certifications like computerized accounting, ERP, and AT.</p>
        <p>In addition, we are committed to developing digital skills through hands-on coding studies, including Python, SQL, HTML/CSS, Tableau, and MATLAB.
        We also host idea workshops that lead to patent and utility model applications, and we support students who are aiming for graduate
        studies abroad through information sharing and guidance.</p>
        <p>Currently, we have 29 active members, including 13 executive members responsible for planning and management.
        Under the guidance of our faculty advisor, we strive to grow as a practical, autonomous, and cooperative learning community.</p>
        <p>We look forward to meaningful connections with those who wish to grow and learn together.</p>
